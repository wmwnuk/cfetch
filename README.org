#+title: cfetch

[[https://i.imgur.com/CxbYwny.png]]

A simple, proof-of-concept system fetch utility written mainly as an excercise in C.

It doesn't really fetch too much at all.

It looks quite clean though, and only supports Linux.

Blazingly fast.

Now also configured with TOML.

** Configuration

Place a config file in `$HOME/.config/cfetch/config.toml`.

*** Example

The colors support values 0-15 (corresponding standard terminal colors). Icons should be single character.

#+begin_src toml
[colors]
    frame = 4
    os = 2
    shell = 1
    term = 14

[icons]
    os = ""
    shell = ""
    term = ""
#+end_src

** Usage
