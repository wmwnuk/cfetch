#+title: cfetch

[[https://i.imgur.com/CxbYwny.png]]

A simple, proof-of-concept system fetch utility written mainly as an excercise in C.

It doesn't really fetch too much at all.

It looks quite clean though, and only supports Linux.

Blazingly fast.

** Configuration

Place a config file in `$HOME/.config/cfetch/config`.

*** Example

The colors support values 0-15 (corresponding standard terminal colors). Icons should be single character.

#+begin_src conf
    frame_color=4
    os_color=2
    shell_color=1
    term_color=14
    os_icon=
    shell_icon=
    term_icon=
#+end_src

** Usage

#+begin_src
Usage: cfetch [OPTION...]
Simple fetch program (that doesn't fetch anything)

  -c, --config=FILE          Config FILE to use
  -n, --no-config            No config file
  -?, --help                 Give this help list
      --usage                Give a short usage message
